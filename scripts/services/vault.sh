#      HashiCorp Vault Setup Script for Workspace-Scoped EaaS
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script configures Vault for a Laravel application with separate read and
# write roles for enhanced security. It prepares Vault to be ready for
# application-driven reads and writes.
#
# Features:
#   - Creates 'kibaops-reads' AppRole for reading & decrypting secrets.
#   - Creates 'kibaops-writes' AppRole for creating/updating & encrypting secrets.
#   - KVv2 secrets engine for versioned secret storage.
#   - Transit secrets engine for Encryption-as-a-Service (EaaS).
#   - Policies are scoped to the 'secrets/workspaces/*' path.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - HashiCorp Vault server is running and unsealed.
#   - `vault` and `jq` CLIs are installed and in the system's PATH.
#   - VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN environment variables are set.
#     (e.g., export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'; export VAULT_TOKEN='root')
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   - VAULT_READ_SECRET_ID: Secret ID for read role (must be provided)
#   - VAULT_WRITE_SECRET_ID: Secret ID for write role (must be provided)
#   - VAULT_READ_ROLE_ID: Role ID for read role (must be provided)
#   - VAULT_WRITE_ROLE_ID: Role ID for write role (must be provided)
